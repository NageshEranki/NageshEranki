I earned an MS in Aerospace Engineering (Control & Dynamical Systems) from UIUC in 2024 and a BS in Mechanical Engineering from Mahindra University in 2020. Through coursework, I have the following competencies:
  - Control Theory/design for linear systems
  - Optimal control (AE 504)
  - Dynamical Systems I (MATH 550)
  - Advanced Orbital Mechanics (AE 502)
  - Mechanical Design

### Master's thesis

My project explores techniques for minimizing informations required for basic control objectives, namely, maintaining a hover position for a [Crazyflie quadrotor](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-firmware). I got to spend a great deal of time working with open-source software and even got to use the AE dept's Qualisys Motion capture system!

### Hopping quadrotor!

A project I am working on to enable hopping quadrotors to push objects around! The build was inspired by the [Hopcopter](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.adi8912) and I was able to get my own Crazyflie quadrotor to hop in under 3 weeks!

### Teaching Assistantships

Throughout my grad program, I had the amazing opportunity to TA for two awesome classes within the [Control Systems Lab](https://coecsl.ece.illinois.edu) complex:
  -  Robot Dynamics & Control (ME 446) :  Spring 2023, Spring 2024
  -  Autonomous Systems Lab (AE 483) :  Fall 2024

I have made it to the [List of Teachers ranked Excellent by their Students](https://citl.illinois.edu/citl-101/measurement-evaluation/teaching-evaluation/teaching-evaluations-(ices)/teachers-ranked-as-excellent) each time!

### Outside work

When I need to look away from screens, I go off on a very long walk (weather permitting!). I enjoy ranking restaurants in the twin-cities of Champaign-Urbana (email me for my recommendations :D )
