## Welcome!

I earned an MS in Aerospace Engineering (Control & Dynamical Systems) from UIUC in 2024 and a BS in Mechanical Engineering from Mahindra University in 2020. Through coursework, I have the following competencies:
  - Control Theory/design for linear systems
  - Optimal control (AE 504)
  - Dynamical Systems I (MATH 550)
  - Advanced Orbital Mechanics (AE 502)
  - Mechanical Design

### Outside work

When I need to look away from screens, I go off on a very long walk (weather permitting!). I enjoy ranking restaurants in the twin-cities of Champaign-Urbana (email me for my recommendations :D )
