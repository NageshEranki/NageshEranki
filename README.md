I graduated with an MS in Aerospace Engineering from UIUC, with a specialization in Control & Dynamical Systems. I deeply enjoy tinkering on hardware and am an avid experimentalist. Through coursework, I have the following competencies:
  - Control Theory/design for linear systems
  - Optimal control (AE 504)
  - Dynamical Systems I (MATH 550)
  - Advanced Orbital Mechanics (AE 502)

### Master's thesis

My project explores techniques for minimizing informations required for basic control objectives, namely, maintaining a hover position for a [Crazyflie quadrotor](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-firmware). I got to spend a great deal of time working with open-source software and even got to use the AE dept's Qualisys Motion capture system!
